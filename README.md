Real-World Asset Auction House

A decentralized auction platform for tokenized real-world assets (RWAs) such as real estate, art, collectibles, and commodities. This project aims to facilitate transparent, secure, and permissionless auctions on the blockchain using smart contracts written in Solidity.

<--Features-->

Tokenization of real-world assets

Timed and reserve-price auctions

Bidding with automatic highest-bid tracking

Escrow and asset transfer mechanisms

Auction settlement and ownership transfer

Audit-friendly event logging
